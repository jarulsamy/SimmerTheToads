# Recap 2

# Tasks Completed

We have written about 1.5k lines of code! Our deliverables are as follows:

### Frontend

- We now have a distinctly separate backend and frontend to develop in parallel, as opposed to our strange hybrid model.
- Lona made a few mockups for the final version of the site.
- Natalie did some shenanigans with react, and approved the PR for the backend/frontend refactor.
- Frontend is buildable!

### Backend

- ...is currently separate from frontend.

# Successes

- Before 3/4 of the group left for AAAI-23, we were at a good spot in terms of our development schedule.
- Now that we're back, we're at a good spot to pick up.

# Challenges

- NodeJS is the devil's work
- Being gone did set us back slightly - however, we've met back up and decided on a new attack plan for the coming weeks.

# Goals for the Next 3 Weeks

### Frontend

- Page design - mockups, implementation, etc. This encompasses most of the work we intend to do.
- Clean up the website
- Create separate pages
- Learn .css for cuteness and design!

### Backend

- Work on developing the algorithm for song evaluation + playlist reordering
- Document existing code

# Completion Confidence

- Lona: 5
- Josh: 5
