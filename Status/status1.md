# Recap

# Tasks Completed
We have written 1572 lines of code!! :D Our deliverables are as follows:

### Frontend - Natalie & Joseph

- Songs can be sent to backend
- User accounts can be authenticated with Spotify
- Not one, not two, but **THREE** pages!

### Backend - Lona & Joshy
- Graphs!! You want 'em? We got em!
