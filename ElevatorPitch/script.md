# Simmer the Toads (:

**What's the need/value of your project?**

- Consider this situation: you are stuck on a long road trip with many people
    you don’t know. Naturally, you all have differing music tastes, and so there
    is little cohesion between all the different songs you may add. Simmer The
    Toads aims to solve this problem (and many others!) by creating a
    collaborative Spotify playlist platform, which not only allows yourself and
    friends to create playlists but to seamlessly transition between music of
    one style to another.

- Simmer the Toads is a Spotify extention that takes in a list of songs
    suggested by a group of people, then makes it into one seamless playlist. It
    connects each of your diverse music tastes, by elegantly arranging your list of songs based on similar genres, and
    creating musical pathways of additional "transition" songs between each unique genre.

- We're extending the use of existing programs such as Boil the Frog (a song
    path generator) and Spotify Enhance (a built in playlist enhancement
    feature) to create a curated listening experience.

**What do you need to be successful?**

- We plan on building a website (or some other equivalent platform) utilizing the React library which allows
    invited members to add songs to a collaborative playlist through code sharing (like Kahoot). We plan on using
    the existing Spotify recommendations APIs integrated with the python library Spotipy to build a cohesive platform with tight integration.
    
- Our code will analyze each song within the playlist and identify distinct genres and styles. Then, we'll group the songs
    into stylistic categories, and connect each category to the next
    through a musical pathway of “transition” songs.
    

**Why are you the right team to solve this problem?**

- Lona: I love making playlists to curate moods and memories - so Simmer the
    Toads was my brainchild to help streamline this experience for groups of
    people with diverse music tastes. I also have done research into the Spotify
    API and understand a lot about what integrations may be crucial to making
    this project a success.

- Josh: I enjoy all kinds of development and have considerable experience with
    creating backend API infrastructures. I am comfortable to flex my role to
    anywhere we may need additional help within the team. Our team has the
    diverse skill set and varied interests to make solving this problem
    possible.
