# Simmer the Toads (:

**What's the need/value of your project?**
- Consider this situation: you are stuck on a long road trip with many people you don’t know. Naturally, you all have differing music tastes, and so there is little cohesion between all the different songs you may add. Simmer The Toads aims to solve this problem (and many others!) by creating a collaborative Spotify playlist platform, which not only allows yourself and friends to create playlists but to seamlessly transition between music of one style to another.

- We're extending the use of existing programs such as Boil the Frog (a song path generator) and Spotify Enhance (a built in playlist enhancement feature) to create a curated listening experience. 

- Simmer the Toads is a Spotify extention that takes in a list of songs suggested by a group of people, then makes it into one seamless playlist. It connects each of your diverse music tastes, gradually taking you from one music style to another, by elegantly arranging your list of songs.

**What do you need to be successful?**
- Spotify has an exceedingly open and diverse set of resources (APIs) for developers. We can take advantage of much of the existing music recommendation tool-set and build a cohesive platform with tight integration with Spotify.

- For front-end development, we plan on using React, a well-documented Javascript library for building user interfaces.

- We plan on building a website (or some other equivalent platform) which allows invited members to add songs to a collaborative playlist. Then, utilizing the existing Spotify recommendations APIs, analyze each song within the playlist and identify distinct genres and styles. Essentially, group the songs into stylistic categories. We can search for songs matching these categories, and fill in large stylistic gaps with “transition” songs.

**Why are you the right team to solve this problem?**
