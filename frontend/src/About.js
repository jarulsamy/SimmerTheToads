            <h1> About Simmer the Toads</h1>

            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>Consider this situation: you are stuck on a long road trip with many people you don't know. Naturally, you all have
                differing music tastes, and so there is little cohesion between all the different songs you may add. Simmer The Toads
                aims to solve this problem (and many others!) by creating a collaborative Spotify playlist platform, which not only
                allows yourself and friends to create playlists but to seamlessly transition between music of one style to another.</p>
            <p>To many of us, music has become more than a daily part of our lives. We listen to and explore new artists all the time.
                A collaborative playlist service where we can come together to listen to the music that we already enjoy, but also
                gently expand our tastes does not exist. Such a platform would aid in artist and genre discovery and even help get you
                more acquainted with the music tastes of your friends.</p>
            <p>When you boil frogs, you don’t put them in a hot pot initially - they’ll just jump straight out. You slowly but surely
                turn up the heat. With our Spotify extension’s seamless musical genre transition tools, before you know it, you and your
                friends (the proverbial frogs) will be “boiled” from Lana Del Rey’s dreamy chords to Nickelback’s 40 year old dad rock.
                The affectionate nickname “Simmer the Toads”, is our homage to this adage, and to the existing Spotify extension named
                “Boil The Frogs” that inspired this project. Simmer The Toads is a new Spotify extension that aims to refine a group’s
                selection of varying artists and genres to create a seamless listening experience.</p>

            <h2>The People <i>--NOT FINAL MUST EDIT--</i></h2>
            <p> Natalie has experience with creating GUIs and is excited to experiment with react. Her role includes mostly frontend
                work (creating the website, adding user functionality, and making an aesthetic application).</p>
            <p>Lona is a Spotify enthusiast and will primarily be helping with the API connections to both the backend and frontend.
                She’s also excited to make the application pretty and practical!</p>
            <p>Josh is a VIM enthusiast (much less interesting than a Spotify enthusiast, he knows). He’ll primarily be working on the
                backend and some of the ML functionality, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly, quickly, and intuitively.</p>
            <p>Joseph enjoys writing elegant and understandable code, mainly because he forgets how his own code works. He worked on the fronted. </p>
